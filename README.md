Dat Registry
===========

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/karissa/dat-registry.png)](http://travis-ci.org/karissa/dat-registry)

This is initially built as a web client that will host a simple index and registry of metadata related to hosted dats. It is *not* a hosting service for dats themselves.

See the website at http://dat-data.com for more information.
