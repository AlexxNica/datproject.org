      <p>This is <span class="footer-emphasized">dathub</span>. A <a href="http://dat-data.com">dat project</a>.</p>
      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>What do we mean by 'collaborate' your data? Right now, your data isn't very collaborated. It might be on dropbox or drive, but then its hard to track changes. If you're lucky, its on github -- but what about your dependencies?</p>

      <p>All we want to do is create a place where your build dependencies and data can be shared, forked, updated, merged, and used by other people.</p>

      <h2>So, I can just edit anyone's data?</h2>
      <p>You can fork their data by cloning it and hosting on your own server. Request to change people's data, and if they like it, they can approve it. We're building this still.</p>

      <h2>How do I start?</h2>
      <p>You should start by playing around with <a href="http://dat-data.com">dat</a> to share your datasets and track changes to them.</p>

      <h2>Cool, dude</h2>
      <p>Yeah it's cool! We need your help! Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/karissa/dathub">github</a>.</p>
