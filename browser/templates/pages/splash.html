<h1>Collaborate your data</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>What do we mean by 'collaborate' your data? Right now, your data isn't very collaborated. It might be on dropbox or drive, but then its hard to track changes. If you're lucky, its on github -- but what about your dependencies?</p>

<p>All we want to do is create a place where your build dependencies and data can be shared, forked, updated, merged, and used by other people.</p>

<h2>Hey wait a sec, Are you storing my data? What do you do with it?</h2>
<p>No, we don't host your data. That'd be hella expensive, yo. But you can host your own by going to our open source repository on <a href="http://github.com/karissa/dathub">github</a>.

<h2>So, I can just edit anyone's data?</h2>
<p>You can fork their data by cloning it and hosting on your own server. Request to change people's data, and if they like it, they can approve it. Cool.</p>

<h2>How do I start?</h2>
<p>You should start by playing around with <a href="http://dat-data.com">dat</a> to share your datasets and track changes to them.</p>

<h2>Cool, dude</h2>
<p>I kno rte</p>
