<h1>Collaborate your data</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>What do we mean by 'collaborate' your data? Right now, your data isn't very collaborated. It might be on dropbox or drive, but then its hard to track changes. If you're lucky, its on github -- but then it probably gets mixed in with all your code edits, or it slows down your commands.</p>
<p>All we want to do is create a place where data can be shared, forked, updated, merged, and used freely by anyone. You host your data and tell everyone a bit about it. We help you keep things together and organized. Collaborated.</p>

<h2>Hey wait a sec, Are you storing my data? What do you do with it?</h2>
<p>No, we don't host your data. That'd be hella expensive, yo. We're a <a href="http://usopendata.org">non profit</a>. At a bare minimum, this is just a metadata tracker and mirror for datasets.</p>

<h2>So, I can just edit anyone's data?</h2>
<p>You can fork their data by cloning it and hosting on your own server. Request to change people's data, and if they like it, they can approve it. Cool.</p>

<h2>How do I start?</h2>
<p>You should use <a href="http://dat-data.com">dat</a> to publish your datasets. We like it probably cause we built it.</p>

<h2>Cool, dude</h2>
<p>I kno rte</p>
